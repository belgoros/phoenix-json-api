# Phoenx API app example

The app was created following this [tutorial](https://lobotuerto.com/blog/building-a-json-api-in-elixir-with-phoenix/).
If you are going to deploy to [Gigalixir](https://gigalixir.com/), there is a typo in the deploy command in the article, which should be instead `git push gigalixir master` (like you do with Heroku).

## To start your Phoenix server

* Setup the project with `mix setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
